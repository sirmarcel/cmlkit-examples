This gives a brief overview over basic tasks with `cmlkit`: Computing the MBTR, and making predictions. In this case, of course this is entirely artificial, since we're just looking at training/testing splits of a dataset where we know the labels.

Intended order:
- `inspect_dataset.py`
- `inspect_model.py`
- `regression_without_explicit_mbtr.py`
- `compute_mbtr.py`
- `regression_with_explicit_mbtr.py`
